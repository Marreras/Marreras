## **_1. A bit about myself_**

### Introduction.

I know, I am not a famous person, not even a celebrity, certainly not an influencer, but I would like to introduce myself to you all.
I am not expecting to grow my audience on my Social Media platforms, I am just learning while having fun.

Furthermore, I would have never thought that I would start learning coding at my age. But here I am, spending hours in front of my two screens, and more importantly, enjoying every second of the process.
Just some months ago, I was just a Deputy Manager in the Leisure Industry, waiting for this opportunity to come.

But I am not a completely stranger to Data Science, as you will see as you read through my profile. 

Maybe together, we can find out, why I did not start coding before. ðŸ˜Š

### Early life and education.

I was born in August 1982, in a city called [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid), the capital of Spain. I was the youngest son, my sister Laura, was four years older than me.

I went to a public school, located in Atocha. This school played an important role in my life, as it is where I met all my best friends, and as today, they still are. The name of my school was [Colegio Publico Menendez Pelayo.](https://es-m-wikipedia-org.translate.goog/wiki/Archivo:Colegio_Men%C3%A9ndez_Pelayo,_Madrid.jpg?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc)

I was never the sharpest knife in the draw, however I was aware of that, this fact, always helped me to get away with all my daily challenges as a child. As my mum always says:

                > " Alvaro, some people require one hour to study something, 
                > whereas other people require more time to study the same thing. 
                > The important thing is that you are aware of that, and put the 
                > effort needed, as well as ressources required, to achieve whatever you want" 

And that is pretty much what I have done all my life, just try to find the tools, the energy, the connections, whatever was needed to achieve what I wanted to. Thanks Mum.

### Young adult and education.

When you are 18 years old, it is never easy to make decisions about your future, and when I had to decide what I would like to study after high school, it was when I realized how important some decisions were, as they could change the rest of my life.

After a lot of thinking, I decided to study Sociology. I really liked it, because it could give me the tools to understand and change society. 

I studied it at [Universidad Complutense de Madrid](https://es-m-wikipedia-org.translate.goog/wiki/Universidad_Complutense_de_Madrid?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc), one of the first Universities established in Spain. 

While studying my degree, I enjoyed an Erasmus Scholarship at the ["VU University"](https://vu.nl/en) in Amsterdam. This was very challenging, on one hand, it was the first time I was living on my own, far from home. On the other hand, English had never been one of my strong points, but from day one, my survival depended on it. It is then, when I realized that, with the right motivation, people can adapt and learn very quickly, and I believe that is partly what could define me, when am motivated, I am unstoppable.

After a couple of weeks, English was not a problem any more, but something I was enjoying while learning it. It was my tool to learn, to make friends , to discover new things.

After I finished my degree, I decided to continue my studies. I was really interested in research methodology, because I liked the idea of creating and using different tool and different approaches to study different events or social objects. I was feeling passionate about the role that the observer plays in the studied object. Because of all this, I got into a Master's Degree; [Research Methodology in Social Sciences: Innovations and Applications.](https://www-ucm-es.translate.goog/metodologiainvestigacion/?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc)

What gave me a better understanding about a wide range of  qualitative and quantitative approaches, as well as a better understanding of the role which the researcher plays in research.

## **_2. A bit about the professional myself_**

### Madrid.

#### Lifeguard.

Since a very young age, I was always passionate about sports. I was playing tennis, swimming, playing basketball and skating. I never really liked football, although all my friends did.

When I turned 16 years of age, I started training with a swimming club, "Club de Natacion Valle del Kas", and someone from the club told me about a job opportunity to work for Madrid Council as a lifeguard. This was a really good opportunity for me, as I could work and study at the same time. 

For the next 8 years, I was working during the summer campaign as a lifeguard and studying during the rest of the year. On top of that, I had access to hundreds of sport facilities. During those years I made excellent friends there.

#### Atrevia.

When I finished my studies in Sociology, and I finished my Master's in Social and Market Research, I started to look for jobs related to my studies. The financial situation in Spain led to the 2008 worldwide financial crisis, which made employment rates sky-high. What this meant for me was, that finding a job, was not going to be easy.

I managed to find an internship in a Communication company called Inforpress, now known as [Atrevia](https://www.atrevia.com/en/). They were doing internal research and communication for large companies. I was part of the Research Department and I really enjoyed becoming part of a proper team, in a real work environment, that was not University any more. I learned a lot in there about day to day research's reality. We were combining different technics and approaches. We designed a questionary for more than 8000 workers from a established energy company, we debug all the data and analysed it. 

#### SocialNoise.

After a year in Inforpresss, and since I could not still get a proper contract, I found another internship in a digital Marketing company, [Social Noise](http://socialnoise.mx/en/). This was a much dynamic job, I was part of the Strategic Planner Department. I was using a lot of new online technics to tracking and monitoring online objects. We also collaborated with some Universities from Madrid to so and study about traffic accident social perception.

I was really enjoying what I was going, however after 4 years working under internship schemes, I decided to move on, and find a place where I could really develop my professional career, as at that point I thought that Spain was not the right place to do so.

### London.

London was the place where I decided to move. My sister was living here, and I guess it is always easier when someone you know already lives there.

#### Divertimenti.

[Divertimenti](https://www.divertimenti.co.uk/) was my first job in London. I was working as a sales assistant in a kitchen and cookery shop. It was not my dream job, but it really gave me the opportunity to meet new people and engage for the first time with the British labour market. 

#### Leisure Industry/ Lifeguard. GLL

After 10 months working as a sales assistant, I got the opportunity to start working as a lifeguard in a swimming pool which I was a customer. It has been in that company, [GLL](https://www.gll.org/b2b),
where i have had the opportunity to develop my professional career.

#### Leisure Industry/ Management. GLL

After ten years in GLL, I managed to go from being a lifeguard with a "0" hours contract to become Assistant Manager at GLL. I have been managing different departments, from the Health and Fitness Department to managing a  4000 members Swimming School, or being in charge of the operations for a really large Sports Centre, with more than 100 members of the staff.

#### Leisure Industry/ Deputy Manager. Harrow School Sports Centre

I am currently Deputy General Manager for Harrow School Sports Centre. As part of my personal and professional progression, I thought that I needed to prove myself competent to find a higher position in a different company to GLL. 

An opportunity raised, and I did not let it go, I became Deputy General Manager for Harrow School Sports Centre. I have not worked there for a long time, but I am learning again, and I can feel my motivation levels picking up once again. 

But I did not stop there, and that is why I applied for the Data Science Bootcamp, I wanted to resume my research studies and career, as I have always felt that I wanted to take it back. And guess what?, I found out about the outcome for both, my job at Harrow and my Bootcamp the same day, and my starting date for both was the 11th March. ðŸ’“ðŸ’“ðŸ’“
