## **_1. A bit about myself_**

### Introduction.

I know, I am not a famous person, not even a celebrity, certainly not an influencer, but I would like to introduce myself to you all.
I am not expecting to grow my audience on my Social Media platfroms, I am just learning while having fun.

I would have never thought that I would start learning coding at my age. But here I am, spending hours in front of my two screens, and more importantly, enjoying every second of the proccess.
Just some months ago, I was just a Deputy Manager in the Leisure Industry, waiting for this opportunity to come.

But I am not a completely stranger to Data Science, as you will see as you read through my profile. 

Maybe together, we can find out, why I did not start coding before. ðŸ˜Š

### Early life and education.

I was born in August 1982, in a city called [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid), the capital of Spain. I was the youngest son, my sister Laura, was four years older than me.

I went to a public school, located in Atocha. This school played an important role in my life, as it is where I met all my best friends, and as today, they still are. The namme of my school was [Colegio Publico Menendez Pelayo.](https://es-m-wikipedia-org.translate.goog/wiki/Archivo:Colegio_Men%C3%A9ndez_Pelayo,_Madrid.jpg?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc)

I was never the sharpest knife in the draw, however I was aware of that, this fact, always helped me to get away with all my daily challenges as a child. As my mum always says:

                > " Alvaro, some people require one hour to study something, 
                > whereas other people require more time to study the same thing. 
                > The important thing is that you are aware of that, and put the 
                > effort needed, as well as ressources required, to achieve whatever you want" 

And that is pretty much what I have done all my life, just try to find the tools, the energy, the concetions, whatever was needed to achieve what I wanted to. Thanks Mum.

### Young adult and education.

When you are 18 years old, it is never easy to make decissions about your future, and when I had to decide what I would like to study after high school, it was when I realized how important some decisoons were, as they could change the rest of my life.

After a lot of thinking, I decided to study Sociology. I really liked it, because it could give me the tools to understand and change society. 

I studied it at [Universidad Complutense de Madrid](https://es-m-wikipedia-org.translate.goog/wiki/Universidad_Complutense_de_Madrid?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc), one of the first Universities established in Spain. 

While studying my degree, I enjoyed an Erasmus Schollarship at the ["VU University"](https://vu.nl/en) in Amsterdam. This was very challenging, on one hand, it was the first time I was living on mmy own, far from home. On the other hand, English had never been one of my strong points, but from day one, my survival depended on it. It is then, when I realized that, with the right motivation, people can adapt and learn very quickly, and I believe that is partly what could define me, when am motivated, I am unnstopable.

After a couple of weeks, English was not a problem anymore, but somthing I was enjoying while leatning it. It was my tool to learn, to make friends , to discover new things.

After I finished my degree, I decided to continue my studies. I was really interested in research methology, becaute I liked the idea of creating and using different tool and different approaches to study different events or social objects. I was feeling passionate about the role that the observer plays in the studied object. Because of all this, I got into a Master's Degree; [Research Methodology in Social Sciences: Innovations and Applications.](https://www-ucm-es.translate.goog/metodologiainvestigacion/?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc)

That gave a deep understanding about different Qualitative and Quantitative approaches, as well as a better understading of the role ehich the researcher plays.
